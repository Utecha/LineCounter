# Changelog
### Introduced on 1/1/24

## The Repo
- *Removed the Lua and Rust branches.

* : I kept the Rust local repo and have moved it into the main repo with the Python version. Rather than separate branches for each, I will be including every version in the main repo.

## C Version 0.0.0

## C++ Version 0.0.0

## CSharp Version 0.0.0

## Odin Version 0.0.0

## Python Version 1.0.0
- Not much to say here.. Last thing I did was move it to a module based system. Everything was done before I made this changelog, though.

## Rust Version 0.1.0
- Same as with Python, except this is still in an early version and is likely to be rewritten completely, so this log is likely become very up to date.

## Zig Version 0.0.0
