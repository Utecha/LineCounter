# LineCounter - Python Edition

## NOTE: README INCOMPLETE
### Will update this on github itself as it is a bit easier to do so there.

This was just a fun little project I decided to work on as an exercise to both learn more about programming in various languages, but also to have a fun little way of tracking how many lines of code I am ultimately writing for various projects. It works to track how efficient you are becoming as a programmer. Meaning, you are able to accomplish the same tasks in less lines of code, though hopefully while maintaining readability, of course!

## Supported Languages

- Python (a given, considering this was the first language I wrote the program in)
- Lua (also a given, if you check the branches)
- Rust (same as lua)
- C 
- C++
- C#
- Objective-C
- Java
- JavaScript/Typescript
- Shell (Bash/Zsh/Fish)
- MATLAB
- PHP
- Ruby
- Swift
- Kotlin
- Go
- SQL
- Dart
- R
- Zig
- Probably a bunch of others I can't think of off the top of my head

If your language does not appear on that list, it still may be supported. Any language with these single/multi-line comment types are supported:

#### Single Line
- "#" (in quotes cause markdown)
- //
- "--" (in quotes cause markdown)

#### Multi-Line
- """ """ or ''' ''' (Python docstrings)
- /* */
- :' '
- %{ %}
- =begin =end

That covers most languages, however if I am missing any commenting styles used by your language, you can request it be added.
